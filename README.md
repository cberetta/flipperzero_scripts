# Flipperzero_Scripts

A collection of script and tool I use with my FlipperZero

### fzsubtk.py

`FlipperZero .sub Toolkit`

I wrote this script to **plot** and **cut** the RAW .sub file that you can capture with Flipperzero. This script make use of **mathplotlib** to plot the data.

An example on how it's possible to load a binary file via BadUSB. I created this for a Windows PC but the idea can be adapted also for other operating systems.  
For a better explanation follow this link: [Load and Run an exe file via BadUSB](./docs/badusb_runexe.md)
